Problem Statement:

Given a date, return the corresponding day of the week for that date.
The input is given as three integers representing the day, month and year respectively.
Return the answer as one of the following values {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}.

Note: January 1, 1971 was a Friday.
Example 1:

Input: day = 31, month = 8, year = 2019
Output: "Saturday"
Example 2:

Input: day = 18, month = 7, year = 1999
Output: "Sunday"
Example 3:

Input: day = 15, month = 8, year = 1993
Output: "Sunday"

 Solution Algo : 
Zeller’s Congruence or Sakamoto's Algorithm. 
Algorithm (Sakamoto's Method)

This formula is highly efficient for computer programs and handles leap years automatically. 
Adjust the Year: If the month is January or February, treat them as months of the previous year.
if month < 3: year -= 1
Use Month Offsets: Use a predefined array t[] to handle irregular month lengths:
t = [0, 3, 2, 5, 0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 4]
Apply the Formula: Calculate the day index h:
h = (year + year/4 - year/100 + year/400 + t[month-1] + day) % 7
Map the Result: The result h corresponds to the following days:
0: Sunday, 1: Monday, 2: Tuesday, 3: Wednesday, 4: Thursday, 5: Friday, 6: Saturday.

JAVA CODE :
class Solution {
    public String dayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {
       
       String days[] ={"Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"};
		
	// Sakamoto's Algorithm
		
	      int[] t = {0,3,2,5,0,3,5,1,4,6,2,4};
		
		if(month < 3){
		    year = year - 1;
		}
		
		// Standard integer divition used by floor values
		
		int h = (year + year / 4 - year / 100 + year / 400 + t[month -  1] + day) %7;
		
		return days[h]; 
    }
}
